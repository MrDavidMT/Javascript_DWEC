/**
 * One classic method for composing secret messages is called a square code. 
 * The spaces are removed from the english text and the characters are written into a square (or rectangle).
 *  For example, the sentence "If man was meant to stay on the ground god would have given us roots" is 54 characters long,
 *  so it is written into a rectangle with 7 rows and 8 columns.
